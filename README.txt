Manipulate a simulated disk, and format that disk, reading and writing of files in the root directory, creation of sub-directories, reading and writing of files in any directory, deletion of files and directories, Make LLFS robust, so that the file system is less likely to be corrupted if the machine it is running on crashes.# Helpful links that helped me write the code:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47981/how-do-you-set-clear-and-toggle-a-single-bithttps://www.programiz.com/c-programming/library-function/string.h/strlenhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9882252/weird-c-compiler-getting-an-error-ld-duplicate-symbol-main/19937679https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_systemhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/log-structured-file-system-lfs/#BugsDoesn’t read files from sub directories flawlessly.Doesn’t update inode map from subdirectories flawlessly either.
