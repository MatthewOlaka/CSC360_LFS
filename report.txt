Matthew OlakaV00888684Assignment 3 ReportThis assignment was to implement a Little Log File System, Specifically to 1. Manipulate a simulated disk, and format that disk, reading and writing of files in the root directory which I managed to implement fairly well, creation of sub-directories, reading and writing of files in any directory which wasn’t implement flawlessly as stated in my bugs, however it was a tradeoff I had to make, deletion of files and directories, was also decently implemented however I did not implement the deletion of directories. Make LLFS robust, so that the file system is less likely to be corrupted if the machine it is running on crashes This was also not perfectly implement therefore the system could get corrupted if the machine it is running crashes(difficult to perfect such a task).
